# Progress Log: Personify
DO NOT USE DATES, PROGRESS HAPPENED CHRONOLOGICALLY TOP TO BOTTOM 

## Grounding and Design
- **Home page complete**: Title, subtitle, and CTA button implemented per design spec. Layout is centered, responsive, and matches the OpenAI-inspired aesthetic.
- **Dark mode**: Implemented using a global ThemeService and a reusable ThemeToggleComponent. Theme state is persisted in localStorage and can be toggled from any page.
- **Design system**: All colors, fonts, and layout strategies follow the design.txt doc. Uses Angular + SCSS for maintainability and learning alignment.
- **Mobile**: Design is desktop/laptop focused per design.txt; mobile is not a priority for this hackathon.
- **Docs**: plan.txt remains the guiding document; design.txt is the source of truth for visual/UX decisions; progress.txt logs all major changes and implementation notes.

## Routing Structure Setup
- **Routing planned for four main pages/components:**
  1. **Home (`/`)**: Welcome, branding, theme toggle, "Get Started" CTA.
  2. **Select (`/select`)**: User selects which areas to customize (category selection, bubbles, etc).
  3. **Flow (`/flow`)**: Main onboarding flow; chat-style Q&A, sidebar, widgets, evolving state.
  4. **Result (`/result`)**: Final output; custom instructions, copy buttons, "New Chat" CTA, no data stored.
- This structure sets up the high-level navigation flow for the SPA. Each component will be developed in detail later, but the routing "connective tissue" will be in place for seamless navigation and future work.

### Notes for Future Development
- Always refer to plan.txt for project goals and flow.
- Use design.txt for color, font, and layout rules.
- ThemeService and ThemeToggleComponent are the standard for dark mode across the app.
- Keep progress.txt updated with all major changes and rationale.
- Routing structure is now defined; each route/component should be developed according to its purpose above.
