# Progress Log: Personify
DO NOT USE DATES, PROGRESS HAPPENED CHRONOLOGICALLY TOP TO BOTTOM 

## State Management and UI/UX Improvements
- **Per-category subcategory selection state**: Implemented robust state management using SelectionService. Each category now remembers its selected subcategories, with suggested defaults on first open and persistent user choices on subsequent opens.
- **Dark/Light mode support**: All relevant UI elements (category label, save button, toggles, etc.) in the select and subcategory overview pages now fully support dark and light mode. Styles adapt cleanly to theme changes.
- **Theme toggle placement**: The theme toggle button is now consistently placed in the top right, matching the home page, and is always clickable.
- **Sidebar open on save**: When saving subcategory selections, the sidebar automatically opens to show progress, improving user feedback and flow.
- **Category circle UI**: Removed the "Click to expand" overlay for a cleaner look. Category circles remain visually distinct and interactive.
- **Subcategory overview redesign**: Switched from floating circles to a vertical list of rounded rectangles with toggles for clarity and accessibility. Suggested subcategories are pre-selected, and toggling is intuitive.
- **Save button**: Prominent, accessible, and styled for both themes.

## Routing and Structure
- **Routing**: Navigation from home to select page is seamless. Select page uses a layout component for consistent structure and sidebar management.
- **Component structure**: Select page and subcategory overview are modular, with clear separation of concerns and state passed via services and inputs/outputs.
